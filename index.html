  <h1>Privacy Policy for scrubDEX</h1>

  <p class="meta"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 1, 2026</p>

  <p>
    scrubDEX is a surgical logging and journaling application intended for personal
    record-keeping, self-audit, and organization. This Privacy Policy explains how
    data is handled within the app.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    scrubDEX does <strong>not</strong> collect personal or sensitive user data on its
    own servers.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>No personal information (such as name, email address, or phone number) is collected by the developer</li>
    <li>No usage analytics are collected</li>
    <li>No crash reports are collected</li>
    <li>No device identifiers, IP addresses, or location data are collected</li>
    <li>No data is tracked, profiled, or monetized</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Data Storage and Processing</h2>
  <p>
    By default, all data entered into scrubDEX is stored <strong>locally on the user’s
    device only</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>Local Storage</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Data remains on the user’s device</li>
    <li>The developer has no access to locally stored data</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Google Drive Backup (Optional)</h3>
  <p>
    scrubDEX provides an optional, user-initiated Google Drive backup feature.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Drive backup is entirely optional and initiated by the user</li>
    <li>Data is backed up to the user’s own Google Drive account</li>
    <li>Data is transferred directly between the app and Google Drive</li>
    <li>No scrubDEX servers are used for storage or processing</li>
    <li>The developer does not access, view, or receive Google Drive backup data</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Use of Google Drive is governed by Google’s own privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Export</h2>
  <p>
    scrubDEX allows users to export their data in <strong>JSON</strong> or
    <strong>CSV</strong> format.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Exports are generated locally on the device</li>
    <li>Exported files are saved or shared at the user’s discretion</li>
    <li>The developer does not receive or transmit exported data</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    scrubDEX does <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, share, or disclose user data to

    If the user enables Google Drive backup, data is shared only with Google Drive
    under the user’s control and Google’s privacy terms. The developer does not
    access this data.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Permissions</h2>
